# Notes


Lecture 1 - Introduction

- Computer Vision as inverse task of image generation
- Statistical generative models
	- Model is a probability distribution
	- Dataset - samples from that distribution
	- After we train the model we can sample from that distribution
	- Have we access to the scalar probability value?
- Examples of using
	- Outlier detection
	- Super-resolution
	- Text2Speech
	- Machine translation as generative problem
- Control signal
	- text
	- low resolution
	- greyscale image
- Inverse problems
	- ?
- Challenges
	- Representation
		- How to model the joint dist. of many r.v. (ex.: different pixels if an image) ? 
	- Learning
		- How to compare probability distributions?
