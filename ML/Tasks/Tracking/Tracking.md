Temporal tracking
- Kalman Filter vs. Optical Flow
- Kalman Filter vs. KCF
    - Can we use SOT as a part of MOT (temporal tracking for MOT)

Optical Flow
- dense vs. sparse
- Dense optical flow calculations can be computationally intensive, which might be challenging for real-time applications.

Why we need tracking-by-detection?
- Simply applying a detector designed for single image level (e.g. Faster-RCNN, R-FCN) to videos could lead to missing detections and false detections due to motion blur and occlusion introduced by video frames.
