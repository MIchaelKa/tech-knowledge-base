# Overview

Datasets
- Datasets has become saturated
	- About [[COCO]] and [[MPII Human Pose]]
- More challenging task - [[PoseTrack]]

Algorithm analysis
- It is hard to tell which details are crucial

# Baseline

Letâ€™s create a simple baseline, how good it can be?

Pose
- a few deconvolutional layers added on a backbone network, ResNet
- No need for skip connections?

Tracking
- Pose [[Tracking]] Based on [[Optical Flow]]
- Flow-based pose tracking
- Detect-and-track (greedy matching method) + optical flow based pose propagation




# Matching

Matching
- Detect-and-track
- greedy bipartite matching algorithm
- Can [[Hungarian Algorithm]] increase accuracy?
	- [[SORT]]
	- *This would be particularly beneficial in crowded scenes with many overlapping poses.*

# Similarity metrics

Flow-based pose similarity metric

Bounding box IoU
- Bounding box IoU as similarity metric
- problematic when an instance moves fast thus the boxes do not overlap

Pose similarity
- Based on Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS)
- could also be problematic when the pose of the same person is different across frames due to pose changing

Flow-based Pose Similarity
- For the idea see **Flow-based pose tracking**

Multi-frames
- consecutive two frames is not enough
- relink instances even disappearing in middle frames
- ?
- see queue


# Flow

Optical flow
- Use optical flow to propagate keypoints and then compute bounding box based on propagated keypoints.
- Output: propagated boxes and keypoints
- Q: Why we need propagate boxes?
	- since it part of 2DHPE pipeline

Q: Which algorithm is used for dense optical flow calculation?
- FlowNet

Flow-based pose tracking
- similarity between shifted poses (using optical flow) and newly detected poses
- Q: What other option, do not have Temporal tracking?

Joint Propagation using Optical Flow
- Temporal information
- Dense? optical flow
- flow field values at joint location (x, y)

# Algorithm

NMS
- boxes generated by propagating joints from previous frames using optical flow are unified using a bounding box Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) operation
- Q: How to unify two boxes? How to get confidence for the box obtained using optical flow.


Queue
- double-ended queue
- queue of tracked frames
- for Multi-frames support

Similarity matrix
for each tracked instance in queue?
