- PoseNet is designed for 6-DOF camera pose estimation, but it can be applied to human pose estimation tasks as well. The network directly regresses the camera's 3D pose from RGB images. While primarily focused on camera pose, the architecture and approach have influenced subsequent human pose estimation work.
