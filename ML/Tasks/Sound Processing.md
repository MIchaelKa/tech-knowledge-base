Mel-frequency cepstrum

**The Fourier Transform**
time→frequency
apply with certain window
Short-time Fourier transform
After this step we get **spectrogram**

**The Mel Scale**

>Studies have shown that humans do not perceive frequencies on a linear scale. We are better at detecting differences in lower frequencies than higher frequencies. For example, we can easily tell the difference between 500 and 1000 Hz, but we will hardly be able to tell a difference between 10,000 and 10,500 Hz, even though the distance between the two pairs are the same.

log-scale?
