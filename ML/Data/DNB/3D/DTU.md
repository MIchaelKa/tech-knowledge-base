Large Scale Multi-view Stereopsis Evaluation

# Overview


indoor DTU dataset
aimed at multiple view stereo (MVS) evaluation

- 80 scenes of large variability
- 49 or 64 accurate camera positions and reference structured light scans
- all acquired by a 6-axis industrial robot
- rectified images
	- 30000 rectified images


Structured Light Scanning
- structuredÂ light scans
- structured light scanner

- How it works
	- Projection of Patterns
		- light patterns (usually stripes or grids)
	- Deformation Measurement
	- 3D Reconstruction


# Evaluation

Metrics
- Accuracy and Completeness

Missing data
- observability mask

Sampling
- more 3D points around strongly textured surface regions
- bias in the evaluation

Meshed surfaces
