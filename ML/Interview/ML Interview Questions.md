Here are some possible questions that might come up during your interview on the topics of Probability, Algebra, and Statistics:

# Probability:

## Basic Probability Concepts:

- What is the difference between independent and mutually exclusive events?
- How do you calculate the probability of the union of two events?
- What is conditional probability, and how is it calculated?

## Bayes’ Theorem:

- Explain Bayes' theorem. Can you provide an example of how it’s used in a real-world application?
	- TBD
- How would you apply Bayes' theorem in a situation where you need to update the probability of a hypothesis given new evidence?
	- Directly?
	- Use previous distribution as a prior.

## Probability Distributions:

- What is the difference between a discrete and a continuous probability distribution?
- Can you explain the properties of a normal distribution? What are some examples of data that follow a normal distribution?
- How do you calculate the expected value and variance of a random variable?

## Inferential Statistics:

- What is the central limit theorem, and why is it important?
- How would you conduct a hypothesis test? Can you explain the concepts of p-value and significance level?
- What is the difference between Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing?

## Regression Analysis:

- What is linear regression, and how do you interpret the coefficients of a linear model?
- Explain the concept of multicollinearity in regression. How would you detect and address it?
- What is the difference between homoscedasticity and heteroscedasticity in regression analysis?

## A/B Testing:

- How do you design an A/B test? What are the key considerations to ensure valid results?
- Explain how you would determine if the results of an A/B test are statistically significant.
- What is the importance of sample size in A/B testing?
