# Overview

This method is used in tensorboard as a way to smoothen a loss curve plot.

Exponential Moving Average is also used is other areas of deep learning, the most notable being some optimization algorithms. It is used in Adam, RMSProp and other similar optimizers to smooth out the gradients to make the path to minimal loss a more direct and straightforward path.
