Large weight values and overfitting

Model complexity
- *number of parameters is not necessarily the most appropriate measure of model complexity*


## Probability Theory

[[Probability Theory]]

[[Joint Probability]]

Sum rule
- [[Sum Rule]]
- Marginal probability
- Summing up of joint probabilities

Product rule
- joint = conditional x marginal

Applying [[Bayes’ Theorem]] to model weights
How we certain about our hypothesis?

Likelihood function in Bayesian and frequentist paradigms
- frequentist
	- w is a parameter
	- [[MLE]]
	- bootstrap
- Bayesian
	- w is r.v.
	- inclusion of prior knowl- edge

Practical use of Bayesian techniques
sampling methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo
