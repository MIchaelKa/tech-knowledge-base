Computer Science | Machine Learning | Deep Learning | Computer Vision | NLP

Knowledge base made in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and inspired by [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/). This approach enables you to create connections between your notes, allowing you to discover interesting relationships and insights. Fully in Markdown.  

**Note**: For an optimal user experience, I recommend using the official Obsidian app. While you can view notes on GitHub, please be aware that there are subtle differences in how markdown is rendered, which may affect the visual presentation.
