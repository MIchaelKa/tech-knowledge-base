# Overview

Применение
- edge detection

Summary
- The derivative of an image has two dimensions. We can take the derivative in the x direction and in the y direction, and together these make up the “gradient vector”
- Image derivatives can be computed by using small convolution filters of size 2 × 2 or 3 × 3, such as the [Laplacian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Laplace_operator), [Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), [Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_cross) and [Prewitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator) operators.
- When computing using the “central difference”

Gradient
- the gradiant direction gives you the normal to the edge (it’s perpindicular to the edge)
- the gradient magnitude gives you the strength of the edge
