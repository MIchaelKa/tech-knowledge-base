	- Rain man
		- Encyclopedic memory of LLMs
	- Memento
	- 50 first dates
		- Context windows is wiped out every time
- Software 1.0
	- Map of github
	- thinking about neural networks as a different kind of classifiers, this framing was a lot more appropriated
- Software 2.0
	- HuggingFace model atlas
- Software 3.0
	- neural networks became programmable
- CAPEX
	- Capital Expenditures

- LLMs have properties of utilities
	- CAPEX to train an LLM
- LLMs have properties of fabs
	- xAI colossus cluster
	- fabless model
- LLMs have properties of OS
	- LLAMA -> Linux
	- LLM -> CPU ?
	- Context window -> RAM
	- text/chat/promts in LLM -> terminal in OS
	- NO GUI invented yet

	- Perplexity
- Generation - Verification loop
	- We have to keep AI on the leash
	- Better to work on small chunks
- Example with the app publication
	- Code is the easiest part
	- Devops is hard, need to be done manually in the browser
- Build for agents
	- Human - GUI
	- Computer - API
	- Agents (Computer + Human) - ?
