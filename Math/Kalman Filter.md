Recursive Filters
- Recursive expression for average
- Factors in the Recursive expression, alpha
- Average Filter

Low-pass filter

Kalman Filter
- It's like low-pass filter with a dynamically changing alpha
- You can apply KF w/o theoretical background

- Input: measurement
- Output: estimate
- measurement and estimate can be different
	- should be related
