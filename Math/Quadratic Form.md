Quadratic Form vs. Hessian
- https://chatgpt.com/c/66e95a55-9d08-8000-ae9c-907ac867c1ad
- [[Hessian]]
- The term involving the Hessian is a **quadratic form**, showing how the Hessian determines the curvature of f(x)
- $x^TAx$ vs. $A$

Depending on the matrix A, the quadratic form can be positive definite, negative definite, or indefinite. This influences whether the quadratic form represents a concave, convex, or saddle-shaped function.
